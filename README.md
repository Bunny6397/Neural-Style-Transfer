# 🎨 Neural Style Transfer with PyTorch

This project implements a **Neural Style Transfer** model using **PyTorch**, which blends the content of one image with the style of another. It generates an image that looks like the content photo painted in the style of the artwork.

## 🧠 Concept

Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a deep learning technique that uses a **pre-trained convolutional neural network** (VGG19) to extract style and content representations and optimize a new image to combine both.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3 and the following libraries:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib pillow
